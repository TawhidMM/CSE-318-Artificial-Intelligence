# AI Assignments

## Overview
This repository contains all four assignments of the `CSE-318-Artificial Intelligence Sessional`. Each assignment is implemented in its respective folder and explores different AI methodologies.

## Assignments

### [Assignment 1: Solving the N-Puzzle using A* Search](https://github.com/TawhidMM/CSE-318-Artificial-Intelligence/tree/main/Offline-1%20A_Star_Search)
This assignment implements the **A* search algorithm** to solve the N-puzzle problem efficiently. The heuristic functions used include **Manhattan distance** and **Hamming distance** to guide the search towards the optimal solution.

### [Assignment 2: Mancala Game Simulation using Adversarial Search](https://github.com/TawhidMM/CSE-318-Artificial-Intelligence/tree/main/Offline-2%20Adversial_Search)
This assignment focuses on **adversarial search** by implementing the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta pruning** to simulate a computer-vs-computer Mancala game. The AI evaluates game states and makes strategic moves to maximize its advantage.

### [Assignment 3: Solving TSP using Hill Climbing Search](https://github.com/TawhidMM/CSE-318-Artificial-Intelligence/tree/main/Offline-3%20Local_Search) 
This assignment implements local search(hill climbing search) techniques to implement a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It combines constructive algorithms for initial tour generation and perturbative approaches for refining the solution.

### [Assignment 4: Decision Tree for Car Acceptability Prediction](https://github.com/TawhidMM/CSE-318-Artificial-Intelligence/tree/main/Offline-4%20Decision_Tree)
This assignment involves implementing a **decision tree classifier** using **Information Gain** and **Gini Impurity** to predict car acceptability based on given attributes. The model learns from labeled data and makes predictions on unseen car information.
